## Project Completion: Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning.
I'm thrilled to share that I’ve successfully completed a mini-project on Customer Churn Prediction! This project is an essential step in my journey toward mastering machine learning and data science. 

## Project Highlights
Here’s what I accomplished in this project:

1️. Dataset: 

  Used the Telco Customer Churn dataset, containing customer information from a subscription-based service.

2️. Preprocessing: 

Handled missing values by imputing them.

Converted categorical variables into numerical values.

Scaled numerical features to ensure uniformity for ML algorithms.

3️. Modeling: 

Trained several machine learning models:

  Logistic Regression
  
  Decision Tree
  
  Random Forest
  
  Support Vector Machine (SVM)

4️. Evaluation: 

Compared model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5️. Insights: 

Identified important features contributing to customer churn, including contract type, tenure, and monthly charges.

6. Prediction:
  
7. Used the best-performing model (Random Forest) to predict churn on new customer data.

## Key Learnings & Insights

Feature Importance: Customers with short tenure and high monthly charges were more likely to churn.

Class Imbalance: Highlighted the need to address imbalanced datasets, as churned customers formed a minority group.

Model Performance: The Random Forest model outperformed others due to its ability to capture complex patterns.

Metrics Beyond Accuracy: Precision, recall, and F1-score were critical for evaluating the model in a class-imbalanced problem.

## Technologies Used:

Python

Pandas

Numpy
